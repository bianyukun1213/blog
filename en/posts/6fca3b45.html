Now is 5:18 A.M. on May 6, 2025, so it is not actually the Labor Day holiday anymore. I woke up at 3 A.M. in the morning, couldn’t sleep well. On this trip I will go to Khabarovsk. But the flight-ticket from Beijing to Khabarovsk is not cost-effective and I’ve decided to fly to Vladivostok firstly and take a train to Khabarovsk. Роман had already helped me purchase train tickets online. I will be living in Khabarovsk on May 7, 8, and 9, then spend the time on May 10, 11, and 12 in Vladivostok. An aunt just dropped a coin. It reminds me of the experience where I also picked a coin on the street of Vladivostok. But the difference is, I knew exactly who dropped the coin this time and I also returned the coin in time. “Здравствуйте, you dropped this.” She didn’t know English, but that was as far as I could speak.</p><h2 id="05-06-Arrived-at-Vladivostok-heading-to-Khabarovsk">05-06 Arrived at Vladivostok, heading to Khabarovsk</h2><p>On the flight from Beijing to Vladivostok, on my left was a couple. The woman sat next to me. I passed them gum. The woman folded a boat out of gum wrapper. During the time remaining, the man was playing Scrabble and the women was reading an e-book.</p><p>We landed at airport VVO. Actually, it is the city Artyom which surrounded the airport. It think it might be considered a low-level city of Vladivostok. I almost missed the train to the downtown because of the language barrier. On the train, I passed the gum to the people near me for another time. An Asian-looking guy gave me a mushroom pie. I got off at the destination, immediately looking for luggage storage. A staff at the station heard I was from Harbin, praising Harbin for its beauty. And I said to him that Vladivostok is also beautiful. The luggage storage required a bank card, so I had to wait for the T-Bank agent on the square. The square was being decorated for the Victory Day. On the square I saw a couple wearing military uniforms (which looked like sailor uniforms) walking hand in hand. In the end, I got the bank card without problems, and I headed to the luggage storage again. During the walk I encountered a Chinese guy using Xiaomi 15 Pro, found that we all took the same flight and the same train. When I was walking along the street, I was attempting to read the signs and slogans. “EXHIBITION”, I was halfway reading it when I realized it was a word in English. Arrived at the station and tried to store my luggage, however, still no luck because I could’t use the Fast Payment System. So I had no choice but to wait for the train in the station. When confirming the train number, the uncle I asked told me that I came here with the wrong carriage number. I knew, I just wanted to check if the train number was correct. After that, I went to the correct carriage at the tail. The uncle was worried and came to confirm with me.</p><p>Seatmates on the train was playing a song I like which was <a href="#Playlist">“Звенит январская вьюга”</a>. I knew this song because of <em>Atomic Heart</em>.</p><p>And I was also taken good care by people. One of these people was Евгений (Yevgeny), the other two were aunts on the beds next to me. The aunts were eating bread and drinking beverage. The setting sun was shining on an aunt’s face, outlining a golden outline, and the drink was shimmering. Евгений came to talk to me, but he didn’t really know how to use a translator. After dozens of rounds I finally understood that he wanted to go to buy some beer with me when the train stops at Ussuriysk. But the stop was short and wasn’t enough. We came back with empty hands. I felt exhausted and fell asleep on the table. Then I was woken up by them. They were saying sentences I didn’t understand. So they asked me to stand up, and started to put the bed for me. The bed where I rested was foldable. If you fold it, it becomes a table. That was the table I was sleeping on. Actually I knew how to use it, I was just lack of sleep and directly fell asleep on the table without expanding it. To express my appreciation, I gave the aunts apples. However, the aunts invited me to their bed and treated me with foods. Breads, eggs, cheese, and Chocolate-filled pastries. They also poured me beverage. Later, I learned that they just came back from China. They had fun for ten days in places such as Yanji, Dunhua, Bohai, Hunchun.</p><div class="image-masonry" id="image-masonry-1810858175m0"><figure class="tide-image-figure"><img loading="lazy" tabindex="0" class="image-masonry-img" src="https://bucket.hollisdevhub.com/blog/posts/6fca3b45/imgs/0506/DSCF0003.webp" alt="A square displays several military vehicles, surrounded by fences and pedestrians.

The hostel was called “Orion”. And the aunt at the front desk was always kind to me with her smile. I went to a nearby small supermarket to buy some food and water, and went to the “Eight-Minute Canteen” for breakfast. Ordered a “white cube”, thinking it was cheese, egg, or salad. Turned out to be liver. It was a good way to taste how Russians cook liver. It tasted good, maybe a little bloody from the liver itself.</p><p>After breakfast, I started walking towards Lenin Square. While walking along the street, I waved to the aunt driver in the tram. A woman wearing military uniform passed by me from behind. I didn’t dare to take a photo. Eventually I found that on Lenin Square there was a rehearsal for the Victory Day, and streets were blocked. I took a photo of a resting military dog, spotted by the soldier nearby. He went to me to ask for the photo of him. I told him embarrassedly that I only shot the dog because I felt it impolite to take photos of the soldiers. I walked along the edge of the square and was asked by another soldier, that how much I had spent on the camera. And I started walking towards the Khabarovsk City Pond. There was a man in military uniform guarding the road every few meters. I went to the Museum of the History of the City of Khabarovsk after visiting the pond. The saleswoman was kind and enthusiastic. They kindly guided me through the museum. At here I saw pictures of Harbin, because Harbin is a friendly city of Khabarovsk.</p><p>There was a television model which was actually a monitor connected to a PC playing <a href="#Playlist">“Soley Soley”</a> in a room with retro decor on the second floor.</p><p>Though the neighborhood surrounded by Khrushchev buildings, walking along the street, I arrived at the position of T-34 tank.</p><p>After that, I called a cab to “The World of Talking Machines” museum. However, only after I arrived there I found it need an appointment in advance. And I still could not use the Fast Payment System. Luckily, I was allowed to have a tour with those who had made appointment. The tour guide Юлия told us the history of audio playback equipments in a vivid and humorous way. Through the translator I understood some of the content, for example, the so-called “патефон” which looked like a phonograph, the story behind the photo “His Master’s Voice”, the bricks in the Far East using Chinese clay, X-ray records, ads on the wrappers of records in from USSR, records published as a journal…</p><p>In a room on the second floor, Юлия introduced us the singer Africa Simone and then played his <a href="#Playlist">“Hafanana”</a>.</p><p>I left the museum and walked to the eternal fire and the church near it by myself. And then I walked all the way to the Khabarovsk Dormition Cathedral and the Khabarovsk Cliffs. I encountered a couple taking photos with their child in the park covering the cliff. The husband asked me if I wanted to visit the cliff and pointed out the route. At the playground below the cliff I knew some young guy. They were called Джоджи (George), Aidan, and Shaw. Aidan took us on a pirate ship, bumper cars and a circular ride. The amplitude was quite large. I hadn’t done these projects for a long time, and I couldn’t help but shout out with excitement. Aidan told me these are Russian entertainments. Hardcore, I commented. And then he led us to an Asian restaurant. Aidan and I both ordered the bibimbap and kimchi cocktail. The bibimbap was delicious, and the kimchi cocktail was salty. During this trip I was so fortunate, everyone was so kind and enthusiastic to me. Now I am writing things down in the hostel, finishing the missing part of yesterday’s experience, not knowing what I’m gonna meet in the future.</p><div class="image-masonry" id="image-masonry-1810858175m1"><figure class="tide-image-figure"><img loading="lazy" tabindex="0" class="image-masonry-img" src="https://bucket.hollisdevhub.com/blog/posts/6fca3b45/imgs/0507/DSCF0029.webp" alt="The exterior of an art studio, with a red sign reading “АРТ-СТУДИЯ”.

When I arrived I found it totally different from what I had imagined. It was an old school with broken ground and old athletic field facilities. Some infrastructure may from USSR. It felt absolutely different from Far Eastern Federal University. However, that made me like here even much. On the street in Russia I can find a lot of beautiful girls but I couldn’t dare to take even one photo. I only take photos of old buildings, Khrushcheves. And here are a lot of old buildings, ones across the road even without window glasses. There is a man with his daughter riding on the athletic field. The daughter seemed at the beginning of learning riding. She looked scared and she cried. The man couldn’t comfort her so he rode a few rounds on his own and left the athletic field with his daughter. Later there was a man, probably a music teacher, coming to the field with a group of young people to practise singing. They performed a lot, and didn’t finish before I left there. At the time it was raining, and I just sat on the bench next to a tree watching them singing. They performed a lot, but I only knew <a href="#Playlist">“Katyusha”</a>.</p><p>As planned, I went to see the Khabarovsk bridge and the Amur River (Heilongjiang). There was a perfect spot on the Google Map and Yandex Map, an abandoned tower. However, when I came there, it was blocked. There was a sign saying words like “This is private property, no entry, there are cameras.”. The fences were newly installed because there was a photos shot on the top uploaded three days ago. Luckily the fences didn’t block it completely. I could get in there on the right side across a short edge. I looked around, didn’t find any camera, nor did I find any wire. So I went directly towards the tower. The tower was about three floors in height, with graffiti and messages. On the tower I took a lot of phots and videos, and stayed there for a long time. During the visit I encountered another person wearing blue. He was recording below me, and we chatted a little using English. Maybe because I stayed too long, I was spotted. Four people came to the tower. I heard the noise and looked down. They were young, so I thought they came here to have a great view or to explore, just like me. I smiled to them naively, only to find out they came to “catch” me. However, they didn’t blame me, nor did they fine me or call the police, they just asked me how I came up here, where did I come from, did I see anybody else. I explained I saw a guy in blue earlier. Of course he had sneaked away already. They drove here two vehicles. The woman opened the gate for me. Apparently they were the people who managed here. The woman told me this place is dangerous. We said goodbye to each other, and the woman made a gesture meaning I was naughty, she won’t blame me this time, telling me to behave myself, then drove away.</p><p>It was enough to me anyway, so I just walked along the road leaving there. A girl in pink, looking no older than 10, rode on her bike to me. She saw me walking along, asked me where I wanted to go. I said I would go back to the hostel. She told me buses come here. I showed her the Yandex Go app, explaining I would call a cab and no need to worry. She then told me a taxi brand, and the price for a person is about 500 rubles. I expressed my appreciation, said goodbye, then she ride away. It actually took me only 318 rubles on the way back. I have a bank card now, even though for the reason I don’t understand I still cannot use the Fast Payment System, I can transfer money directly to the driver and don’t have to worry about losing a large amount of cash.</p><p>However usually I have to get down to squeeze through the space below the gate to reach the hostel because the hostel is located in an apartment complex. Today I asked two children for help. They seemed to tell me that they couldn’t open the gate from inside as well. So they climbed across the fence with spikes on it, showed me the way to another gate. There happened to be a person passing through so I made my way back.</p><p>An uncle who booked the bed opposite mine greeted to me, saying his name is Айдар.</p><p>It’s only half past twenty, and the sky is just beginning to turn dark. I still can go out and have some fun.</p><p>I spent some time by myself at the bar called Чилл Хаус. Ordered two glasses of Germany beer, chatting with Aidan and a friend from Blagoveshchensk called Вика, watching people at other tables smoking hookah, watching a film, or playing GTA V. The waiter was very kind and waited patiently for me to use the translator.</p><div class="image-masonry" id="image-masonry-1810858175m2"><figure class="tide-image-figure"><img loading="lazy" tabindex="0" class="image-masonry-img" src="https://bucket.hollisdevhub.com/blog/posts/6fca3b45/imgs/0508/DSCF0305.webp" alt="A wide road with streetlights leads to a building marked “ХАБАРОВСКИЙ ПОЛИТЕХНИЧЕСКИЙ ИНСТИТУТ,” with a large satellite antenna in front of it.

I found there was no network on my phone, so I could’nt use Yandex Go or speech recognition. I had to run to the square. It actually begins at ten, and I arrived there around nine, so I got a position in the front. Unfortunately, the view was still blocked. However, I brought a portable tripod, with its middle pillar removable as a selfie stick, so my phone had a better view than me. There were kids riding on parent’s necks. I also found a lot of people bringing boards with photos with them. I though they were heros’ relatives. Вика later told me that this was the Immortal Regiment. The content of the ceremony was either too far from me or was blocked by people infront of me. However, our side was closest to the cannon, so the noise was very loud when the cannon was set off, which was a bit scary.</p><p>After the ceremony I bought a belt, then came to the City Pond. A location was set up where people could pick up free food. But the lines were long. I found a booth selling Russian skewers with bread, onion, and sauce. Each skewer is 300 rubles. I bought a serve. However, due to offline I could not use the translator, there was some problem with the conversation, resulted in me buying two skewers and being charged 600 rubles. These pieces of meat was quite big and each piece could fill my mouth. The spices and salt were heavy, and there was also some grease, so I got tired of it before I could finish one skewer. I felt a little nauseous after eating them all, but it was really enjoyable to chew the meat in my mouth. Later, there was performance in the park. I watched for a while and started going back to the hostel.</p><p>The aunt at the front desked smiled at me, telling me here came two friends. I was told later that they both studies in Vladivostok, and one of them lived in Jiangbei, Harbin. I picked some photos, slept for a while and wrote some words in the post. However, the content I am writing now was not written at that time. Currently I am on the train. The aunt made me a cup of tea with three blocks of sugar, and then brought me a snack, saying it was a gift. The television was broadcasting Victory Day live. There was still some time before the official start. It was the interview then. I took a shower, bought water and cookies. It was raining. The same guy from last night when I came back from the bar opened the gate for me. Went back to the room, packed things up, and left. I told the aunt, they (the aunts) had been nice to me, and I really liked this hostel, and the city Khabarovsk. Also I also told her that I made friends here, and I might come back in the future and would choose to stay at here again. We hugged. She told me how to get to the station with care, even though I didn’t understand.</p><p>Aidan said they were coming to see me off. But I actually arrived later than I told him. Aidan and George came to say hello. They brought me a bag with an umbrella and snacks. These are a gift to me. They came to see me off in the rain, held the umbrella for me and watered themselves, talked to the train staff, and helped me find the place. We hugged and said goodbye. I was so happy, however the happiness is always short-lived, I had to leave before I feel it’s enough, so I was a little sad. Until I found the red envelope in the bag. Inside it, it was our photo with the text “We will remember and love Yukun”. It was like the moment when I was drinking lonely on the square in Vladivostok, and the caring aunts came to talk to me. I feel sad no more.</p><p>It’s 22:42, and I am lying on the bed. Евгений, the aunts on the train, the staff who took care of me on the train, the hotel owner, my friends who played with me in the playground and came to see me off at the end, the waiter in the bar… These people together made up my wonderful experience in Khabarovsk. Tomorrow I’ll be in Vladivostok and see my older friend Роман.</p><div class="image-masonry" id="image-masonry-1810858175m3"><figure class="tide-image-figure"><img loading="lazy" tabindex="0" class="image-masonry-img" src="https://bucket.hollisdevhub.com/blog/posts/6fca3b45/imgs/0509/DSCF0621.webp" alt="A large number of soldiers are lined up in the square, with a fountain and spectators in front.

Роман drove Даня (Daniya) and me to visit various tourist attractions. We had planned to go to an off-road track outside the city. Роман said it was a men’s activity and Юлия was not interested so she didn’t come. Even though I’ve made preparations in advance, I still got my shoes covered with mud at the off-road track. We took photos, didn’t stay long. And the we went to the most popular beach in summer. At there my shoes got wet. Then, the glass beach. It would be beautiful if it was a sunny day. However, it was raining today, the rain soaked the glasses, which was also very beautiful. It was forbidden to collect the glasses there, but I still stole one. At last, he drove me to an observation deck on the mountain. I was able to see Vladivostok in all directions. However, it was windy and could. Даня was naughty, running around. When he ran far away, Роман would say “Пока пока.”. Роман drove me back to the hostel, telling me he would go back to the home, change clothes and then deal with work matters. He would see me again in the evening. I was brushing my shoes in the hostel.</p><p>My shoes were not dry yet, but at the agreed time in the evening, I put on my slippers and went to the Hans restaurant that Роман had booked. The Hans here did not serve buffet but a la carte. Together with Вова (Vova, I called him Volod last year.) and Даша (Dasha). Вова the “boss friend”, manages multiple assets in Russia. Юлия was taking care of Даня so she didn’t come. We had the sausage platter with sauerkraut and broccoli, fried fish, creamed mussels and fried brown bread. And then came Сергей (Sergey) and Кристина (Christina). Сергей is a firefighter and Кристина runs a real estate business in Thailand. Максим also came here. I told Максим he looked more handsome than the last time we met in Suifenhe. Вова explained to me he just had his hair cut. We talked something interesting, for example, Chinese people have a stereotype that Russians drink a lot, and if they run out of alcohol, they start drinking antifreeze. “Правда.” said Вова. If they ran out of alcohol, they were going to drink my lens cleaning paper. And also, we talked other things such as mortgages, a better life-style, and my Squidward-like outfit. They also taught me Russian expressions such as “пекинской” for Chinese Cabbage, “Хорошо сидим.” when the party is holding well. When the party is holding well, I can also say “заебись”, but it is not a good word. I didn’t understand, and when Роман tried explaining to me he mentioned “操你妈”, which made me laugh for minutes. I then explained to him what does it mean, that it refers to someones’s mother but not actually refers to her at the same time. Before leaving, the last shot is called “на посошок”. And when I need a little drink I should say “накапать”. Кристина asked me if I had tried Borscht before. I said no, but we have something similar in Harbin, called “苏伯汤”, with tomatos instead of beets. So they orded it for me. The flavor was rich and delicious. I also had a taste of marinated pork. They told me, in Russia, there is a soup called “щи” and there is a saying about it “щи is enough to wash your penis.”. It‘s hard to explain, just meaning there is nothing in this soup. I also explained to them the names of some Northeastern dishes, how to use the Chinese input method, and I learned that Максим studied Chinese at university. In Russia, people say toasts when they drink. And the newcommer would immidiately say a toast. Роман told me a common one is “For a strong penis and money.”. Кристина wished everyone had dry feet. I wished us always in a mood to pursue our dreams. And also there was “Pray for those who are no longer with us.”, however, this time we didn‘t cheer because it was for those who had passed away. And “Спасибо деду за победу.”—“Thanks to grandpa for the victory.”. “For the relationship between Russia and China.” And more… At the meal they gave me a Russian name “Юра” coming from my Chinese name “Юкун”.</p><p>I heard a song that was somewhat familiar coming from the second floor, and I asked Роман. It was <a href="#Playlist">“Матушка”</a>.</p><p>After the meal at Hans, Роман waited for me to change into more suitable pants and shoes at the hostel. Then we went to the Moonshine bar. I met Максим‘s wife and her younger sister Вероника. Next to Вероника there was another woman but I don‘t know who she was. Вова told me they might have a “Russian bath” tomorrow, a traditional Russian activity, which looks like a sauna on the sea, and I could join in.</p><div class="collapse"><a class="collapse-ctrl" href="javascript:void (0);" rel="external nofollow noreferrer" onclick="collapseToggle(this)"><span class="collapse-hint-show">This section is collapsed because it contains mild sexual descriptions, click to expand</span><span class="collapse-hint-hide">Collapse</span></a><div class="collapse-content"><div class="content-flex"><div style="width:100%"><p><strong>Dark Dreams strip club</strong></p><p>“Vodka Hunter” and “Strip Club Hunter” Максим asked if I was willing to go to a strip club. I didn‘t successfully come into one last year, and today I had another chance so I said yes. Даша and Вова drove Максим, Роман, and me to a strip club called Dark Dreams. It was also Роман‘s first time to get into such a place. He was just here to accompany me. There were a lot of people, noisy. Also a lot of girls, some in underwear, some half naked, some fully naked, dancing in the pool or on the desk, or walking around looking for a customer, or sitting on a man‘s leg or lying in his arms flirting. They all wore very high heels, so almost all of them were taller than me. Максим and Роман wanted to introduce me to a seven-minute private dance, so they found a girl wearing black. I asked Максим about the price. About 3000 rubles. They persuaded me many times, and the girl also flirted with me many times, and even took my hand and touched her upper chest. But I was unmoved… They thought I thought it was too expensive and wanted to pay me, but I interrupted them. To be honest I was just too nervious, had no idea what to do. Although there were plenty beautiful girls, and I were also looking around, but there was no sexual arousal at all. Even when the girl put my hand on her upper chest. At that moment I had only one thought: I had to be responsible to my future girlfriend who might not like such activity, so I shouldn‘t do it. Later the girl left angrily. Максим, Роман, and I just sat on the back of the sofa. They didn‘t understand why I would not watch the private dance at all. After that when we were leaving, I told them the reasons. Actually I didn‘t understand either, wouldn‘t their wives be angry knowing they came here with me? Максим said she would, but it was none of my business. Роман also told me later that Юлия was a liitle angry. My friends wanted me to enjoy the private dance, however, I kept hesitating and didn‘t agree, so we spent nearly an hour standing there, and Максим even paid for the drinks. Actually I was also very conflicted. Now it‘s the next day and I am sober. Thinking back, I was a litlle stupid. I don‘t even know which species my future girlfriend will be, what was I worrying about? However, if I have to make the decision again right now, I will still be conflicted becase I will still be nervious.</p><figure class="tide-image-figure"><img loading="lazy" tabindex="0" src="https://bucket.hollisdevhub.com/blog/posts/6fca3b45/imgs/0510/IMG_20250511_022148.webp" alt="The exterior of the building at night, with the words “Dark Dreams” on the front and the “паркет классик” logo below.

She is the third Вика I mentioned in this post. Honestly I don’t know if she would let others call her Вика. I know a Russian name may correspond to multiple nicknames, and multiple names may correspond to one nickname, and nickname is usually for close people. However, for the name Виктория I only know the name Вика, so I’ll just call her Вика for now. She looked cool in the photos, and she is cool. However when I actually met her, she was dressed differently, looked cute, and her voice was softer than I had thought.</p><p>Her birthday is March 2, so she is only more than half a year older than me. She likes reptiles, and has snakes and spiders at home. She currently works in a gym because she likes to climb high and has strength and a good sense of balance.</p><p>We met in front of the Museum of the History of the Far East. She invited me to a pizza shop across the street. When heading to the museum, in the underground passage I encounted my buddies from the Orion hostel. They just arrived at the station preparing to have a fast food meal. That was the first suprise in this cold morning. On the bench I waited for Вика. I brought her two boxes of Daoxiangcun snacks. She gave me Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment and breads made by her grandmother. She said the book was very precious to her because it had accompanied her through her school days, and she then gave the book to her younger brother, who also took it to school. She said Russians thought books are the best presents. I once asked her, were she really going to give such a precious item? She answered yes. Because she is going to be married, (On May 28, if I recall correctly. And her mother still doesn’t know about this, not even about her fiancé.) she is planning to move to Moscow or Saint Petersburg with her future husband. She can’t bring many precious items with her, including her pets. Actually she was not born here, but in Горные Ключи which is 350 kilometers away from here.</p><p>We went to some observation deck on the mountain. There was a water tower, two swings, and a cross. She showed me her home opposite the swing. However, she is going to move to another place today. White mist enveloped the building and the air was moist and cool. On the swing she swung so high and I accidenttaly swung my shoes off because I had drunkenly laced them up last night before going to the bar. She climbed on the fence proficiently while I was clumsy. Going up, she invited me to have a taste of her mashed potatoes and chicken with carrots. They were good, so I praised her for her good cooking skills. She knew the difference between Chinese and Russians: when being praised, Chinese would say: “哪里哪里。” (“So-so.”), and Russians would express gratitude. Again, she climbed quickly towards the cross on the rocks and the peak of the mountain. I had to use both my hands and feet carefully. And when I climbed over the obstacles, she had already been waiting on the next spot. We took photos on the top. The breeze brought mist, refreshing, in distance the bridge was shrouded in the mist. When we were going down, she told me once she played Chinese chess with her Chinese firends, they praised her as a good chess player. Well, I don’t know how to play Chinese chess at all, so to me she is absolutely a good chess player. We waited for the cab. She tried to find a clover with four leaves. To be honest, I didn’t know if they were clovers. She also showed me how to use my thumb to “launch” the “bud” of a certain plant and asked me to try it.</p><p>We arrived at the reptile house she used to work at. She didn’t bring her bank card because she lost it once before and didn’t want to lose it again. And I told her, in China, we also don’t carry bank cards often because of the online payment system. On the way, we passed her former school, Vladivostok State University, and her brother’s school, where a lot of people were gathered. She showed me a photo of her and her younger brother, as well as a photo displaying a tattoo of her ex-boyfriend’s name on her heel so she could step on him every time she walked. At the reptile house I saw an animal that I had never seen before — A “lizard” without feet. I taught her words such as “蜥蜴” (lizard), “游泳” (swimming), and “交通堵塞” (traffic jam). And I learned “пиздец” from her.</p><p>Time to say goodbye. She had to prepare for the move, and I had to go to the airport. Today’s experience has made me pleased, so I said to her “You made my day.”， telling her we could meet in Moscow or Saint Petersburg in the future.</p><p>I will go back to Beijing and live on my own for some days, so I didn’t buy any gifts. I have been eating cookies these days and I’m enough of them. Moreover, after meeting with Вика, I fell down on the road while rushing to the hostel, scraping my hand and even my arm through my clothes, so I can be considered to have brought back some “local” specialties. When I arrived in China, I felt for the first time at Capital Airport T3 how big this airport was. I even had to take a train to travel between different areas.</p><div class="alertbox alertbox-warning"><p>Some of the following images contain various reptiles or arthropods, such as snakes, lizards, spiders, centipedes, etc., which may cause discomfort.</p></div><div class="image-masonry" id="image-masonry-1810858175m6"><figure class="tide-image-figure"><img loading="lazy" tabindex="0" class="image-masonry-img" src="https://bucket.hollisdevhub.com/blog/posts/6fca3b45/imgs/0512/IMG_20250512_084024.webp" alt="On a postcard, two cartoon bears are taking a selfie with a red church and snowy scenery in the background.
