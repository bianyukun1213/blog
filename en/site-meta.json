Despite being a local, they had never visited the festival before. Initially apprehensive about the noise and potential drunkenness, the author ended up enjoying the event sober, excitedly taking photos of international models and other festivities. They experienced both excitement and regret, particularly about missing opportunities for photos and interactions. After attending the opening ceremony, which featured performances and fireworks, they found themselves tired and missed the chance to have a beer due to long queues.
