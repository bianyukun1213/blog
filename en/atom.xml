It was my birthday. My friend in the high-school came back to our hometown Harbin recently. He reached me and we hung out walking along the Central Street together. Harbin is cold now but also hot because it attracts tourists from many places every winter. Soon it’ll become prettier when the ice lights are assumbled and the Big Ice and Snow World finished its construction. The ninth Asian Winter Games will be held here in less than 60 days so there will be more people from other countries this winter. I’ve never been so proud of my hometown.</p><p>We had dinner in a “Russian restaurant” near the Central Street. I don’t really know whether the foods there taste right like the actual Russian version since I had not tried traditional Russian foods when I was at Vladivostok. But the foods we ordered were cheap so there is nothing to complain about.</p><p>Speaking of Vladivostok… Well, that topic is just inevitable even when we were at the dinner table. It’s near the end of the year now, I have to say the trip to Vladivostok forms my best memories this year. (And my graduation from the university is the second best.) I’ve seen beautiful sceneries and encountered nice people during the trip. Lately I’ve been feeling sad sometimes. Because the memories are too good, when switching back to the reality I naturally feel sad. I’m 24 now and yes I know I’m still young, but actually not that young… Considering how time can fly flawlessly. There’s a thought (or joke?) that seems deeply rooted into Chinese people’s mind, that people of 20+ years old will soon turned into 30. We call it “奔三”. Yeah maybe it’s just a joke that people mention a lot. But they are not mentioning it without reasons. Boring life, health issues, low salary, lack of targets and energy, I have already found them chasing after me. Most of us once had dreams like traveling around the world when we were kids, myself included. As I grew I found them probably just dreams… And I’m just an ordinary person. And there are a lot people live hard just to be ordinary.</p><p>Eh… Yeah that sounds like I’m overreacting — a 24 year-old teenager talking about aging and saying “Welcome to adults’ world where none of your child dreams came true.”. Haha! Well, aging’s not a problem to me but making no improvements while aging is. I’ve lost years during the COVID-19 epidemic isolation at the university, and I don’t want to lose more. I don’t want the trip to Vladivostok to become the end of my experience at a global scale but to become the begining. Go to new places. Make new friends. Harbin is okay but I won’t stay here for lifetime. I need to make improvements. I’m not good at talking to people, especially when it comes to my family, or under certain circumstances. I don’t contact my friends actively, or I don’t contact them at all. When I was in the university, even to the girl I was fond of I couldn’t speak a word. I’m better now but still I talk to myself most of the time. I used to find myself comfortable with loneliness in the past, but recently I do feel lonely. I need to do something. So, make improvements. Not just on social skills but on every aspects. A 30 year-old of me is not terrible. A 30 year-old of me with no difference to the current me but just older, is disaster.</p><p>That’s the thing I want myself to remember on my birthday this year. And gosh, look what I’ve written… I just wrote dozens of sentences to myself, again! I was about to share my activities yesterday in the first place! (And of course, also write to myself something.)</p><hr><p>The End</p>]]></content><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy birthday to not-that-happy myself!</p>]]></summary><category term="Life" scheme="https://his2nd.life/en/categories/life/"/><category term="Blah blah blah" scheme="https://his2nd.life/en/tags/blah-blah-blah/"/></entry><entry><title>The 22nd China Harbin International Beer Festival</title><link href="https://his2nd.life/en/posts/dfeb1577.html"/><id>https://his2nd.life/en/posts/dfeb1577.html</id><published>2024-07-06T15:04:23.000Z</published><updated>2024-07-07T11:21:56.000Z</updated><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><b>You can visit <a href=https://his2nd.life/en/posts/dfeb1577.html target=_blank>https://his2nd.life/en/posts/dfeb1577.html</a> for better layout.</b></p><hr><p>Not a sip, not a penny out of pocket, just wandering and taking photos.</p><div class=ai-generated-summary><div class=title><p>AI-generated summary</p></div><div class=content><p>The blog post recounts the author's first experience attending the 22nd China Harbin International Beer Festival. Despite being a local, they had never visited the festival before. Initially apprehensive about the noise and potential drunkenness, the author ended up enjoying the event sober, excitedly taking photos of international models and other festivities. They experienced both excitement and regret, particularly about missing opportunities for photos and interactions. After attending the opening ceremony, which featured performances and fireworks, they found themselves tired and missed the chance to have a beer due to long queues. Their journey home involved a long walk and a costly cab ride, reflecting on the day's mixed emotions and missed opportunities. Despite feeling a bit down, the author considered the day a personal improvement in their social courage.</p></div></div><span id=more></span><hr><p>Well actually, I did cost a little by calling a cab on the way back home.</p><p>As a native of Harbin, I had never attended the famouse international beer festival before. So yesterday I planned to come to the Sun Island this weekend to take photos and have some drinks. I’m not a big fan of crowded and noisy places — once I went to the Strawberry Music Festival, the loud sound field there made my heartbeat follow the crazy sonic, which was really uncomfortable, and I don’t want to go to any music festivals anymore. There certainly will be loud musical acts on this beer festival, but also, there will be fireworks and drone show this evening. So, I’m in.</p><p>I had worried that I might have got drunk, laid down somewhere, and lost my camera tody. It turned out, instead of got drunk, I was taking photos all over the place, excitedly. Why was I so excited? Cuz I met some international ladies! They could be from Russia or somewhere. “你要唠这个我可就不困了啊！” At first, I was shooting models in shiny branded green dresses with fashionable feather hats, in front of the Harbin Brewery shed. Then came several international ladies to join us. This time I got a good positon with no one blocking my lense anymore. Aunties also eager to take photos with these ladies. I was shy after all! Asked the guy on my left to take a photo of me with the lady, but he was picking photos on his phone, didn’t hear me. I just didn’t have the heart to mention it again, thus missed the opportunity! After that I thoght, wasn’t I stupid?! I’ve got a camera with a flippable screen which allows me to take photos on my own! There was a chance in front of me and I didn’t appreciate it. If the God gave me another chance, I would be brave enough to ask for a photo together, even though we speak different languages. It sounds like a line from a movie or TV show, reminiscent of <em>Big Little Lies</em>, but that’s really what I was thinking.</p><p>The God had decided to indulge this silly guy again. It was international models wearing flesh-colored tights and gorgeous wings on the back, just like in the promotional pictures. This time I was (being surrounded by the crowd and forced to walk close to them) following them to shoot all the way. They also interacted with people, so I asked for photos together natually. They were all friendly. Ha, so far no regrets. I felt like this month would have been worth it.</p><p>It was almost the time for the opening ceremony and I ran to set up my tripod in front of the main stage. On my left there was a person talking to me. It was Ms.Luo! She was my teacher. The woman next to her seemed to be her mother. This was… unexpected at all. After the small talk, they went for a better place to watch the ceremony, I could never find them again. I was wondering if I could take a photo with her, because it was really a surprise that we met in this place. But I hesitated, and before I could ask, I couldn’t find her! The God has spoiled me enough. I asked for her number from my ex-roommate, but the signal was so bad we couldn’t hear each other, so she hung up. I texted her then. She stated that due to the poor signal, it would be hard enough for us to find each other, so why don’t I just enjoy the festival on my own. All right… I figured they might have left here. So that’s the pity of the day.</p><p>The opening ceremony began with some singing and dancing. Afterwards, the hosts introduced the newly constructed “Little Ice and Snow World” project this year, which allows visitors to get a glimpse of what Harbin looks like in winter, at this time. It was also announced that the (“Big”) Ice and Snow World had become a permanent project, which gives visitors different experiences in different seasons. There were congratulatory messages. Then, as I recall, it was the much anticipated Sun Honglei who came on. He chatted with the hosts about some topics that were already stipulated in the script, advertised Harbin Brewery, also expressed his blessing for Harbin, etc. Then there was the announcement that the Ice and Snow World had achieved Guinness World Records certification. I actually have learned these during the afternoon rehearsal. At that time, Sun Honglei was a shy girl, how time flies!</p><p>Next up was an exciting fireworks and drone show. On the left side of the field were the drones and on my side were the fireworks, both going on at the same time. I was so busy shooting that I blured some of the photos because of inapproprite shutter setting. But it’s better than nothing, and it’s always good to leave a record.</p><p>It was about eight o’clock in the evening. I was considering drinking beer at the Harbin Brewery shed. Problem is, there was a long queue, and I was already a bit tired. Thought that I wasn’t fortunate enough to enjoy a cup of cold, refreshing beer, I just left. And again, after that I found myself damn stupid. There were other “beer gardens” to accommodate me, and I just left! Maybe I was really exhausted… During that time, I met a photographer and a reporter from Heilongjiang Televison, I wanted to take a photo of them. However, the reporter realized I was looking at her, so I was too embarrassed to take the photo. She came up to me and asked where I was from. Of course, Harbin… Then she said goodbye, because she was looking for visitors from out of town to film a interview. Okay then. It’s just… it was also my first visit to Harbin International Beer Festival, and I was equally excited and thrilled.</p><p>Almost nine o’clock, time to leave. However, the line outside the subway station was long enough to fill a street, thus the subway station was restricted. Wasn’t lucky to take the subway when the station entrance is just steps away from me. Then I decided to take the bus. So I walked and ran all the way from the Sun Island to the Central Hospital bus stop. There were also a lot of people who chose to walk back to the south side of the river, walking in several lines on the river bridge. The traffic police even thoughtfully directed cars to avoid us. I don’t think this bridge normally allows people to walk on it. Any way, tired but still had a little energy, I walked and ran kilometers to the bus stop, eventually missed the bus… It was less than a hundred meters, I think, but I couldn’t run anymore and had some heat stroke… Thought I might had missed the last bus, I just took a cab. The cab arrived, with the next bus… Fuck. While I was waiting for the cab, I checked the map app, it told me the next bus wouldn’t be here for another ten minutes or so! In the end, I spent eighteen yuan for the cab, knowing that I’d be an asshole if I just refuse the cab drivers’s service and take the bus to save money.</p><p>And here I am, sitting in front of my PC, organizing photos and thoughts. I did feel a little upset on my way back home. Will today end like this? When will be the next time I experience such excitement mixed with exhaustion? Guess I just can’t let go of these beautiful international ladies after all. Didn’t take enough photos. I have to say that I never had the courage to go and take a photo with strangers before, so today was actually an improvement. It’s just… Will I get more chances in the future? Will I go abroad? Maybe marry an Russian woman. Haha, what am I day-dreaming (Well it’s night…) of? I know it’s ridiculous. I can’t even socialize with other people. I can’t even find a girlfriend. Marry an Russian woman? Nonsense. Perhaps I should have just found another place for cups of beer back then, so I wouldn’t be upset.</p><p>And tomorrow I would be a fine guy again. Just kidding, it’s already “tomorrow” now… I’ll attach the photos later, I have a bunch of useless shots now.</p><div class=image-masonry id=image-masonry-n1668537254m0><div

Through Kristof’s articles, I learned about the <a class=link href=https://indieweb.org/>IndieWeb <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> community, which led me to other technologies that associated with it, like <a class=link href=https://microformats.org/>microformats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class=link href=https://indieauth.net/>IndieAuth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class=link href=https://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth>RelMeAuth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class=link href=https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/>Webmention <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc. It turns out that there is a bunch of people in the world who use their indie websites as primary online identities, and also use a set of open technologies and standards to communicate and interact with each other on their websites.</p><blockquote><p>不觉得这很酷吗？作为一名理工男我觉得这太酷了，很符合我对未来生活的想象，科技并带着趣味。 <sup class=footnote-ref><a href=#fn1 id=fnref1>[1]</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>I’d like to try to be part of that community. I have already got an indie website and my personal domain. The implementation of IndieAuth and RelMeAuth support is also easy. The next thing is to implement microformats and Webmention. So I referred to Kristof’s three tutorials: <a class=link href=https://kiko.io/post/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb/>“Hexo and the IndieWeb” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class=link href=https://kiko.io/post/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Sending-Webmentions/>“Hexo and the IndieWeb (Sending Webmentions)” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class=link href=https://kiko.io/post/Hexo-and-the-IndieWeb-Receiving-Webmentions/>“Hexo and the IndieWeb (Receiving Webmentions)” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, along with other resources such as <a class=link href=https://blog.xiang578.com/note/641ea60f-a31e-4979-9327-c50509c146e3.html>“webmention 实现参考” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by <a class=link href=https://twitter.com/xiang578>Runye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class=link href=https://jason-memo.dev/posts/webmention/>“透過 webmention 來搜集 blog 的社群迴響” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by <a class=link href=https://jason-memo.dev/>Jason Chen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, to make some modifications to my blog.</p><p>There were some hiccups during the modification. <a class=link href=https://github.com/EvanNotFound/hexo-theme-redefine>Redefine <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the Hexo theme I use, uses <a class=link href=https://tailwindcss.com/>Tailwind CSS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to write some of its styles, which leaves many class names that start with <code>h-</code> in the HTML structure, causing some microformats parsers to generate incorrect results. So I had to use a <a class=link href=https://hexo.io/api/filter>filter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to make some changes to the theme by replacing class names that start with <code>h-</code>, with other class names. After the replacement, the h-entry I made seems to be parsed correctly. For interactive links that require special class names like <code>u-in-reply-to</code>, <code>u-like-of</code>, I would write them in the front-matter, insert them into the page with a filter and hide them. After testing, I found that it is better to insert only one interactive link in an article, and once the interactive link is inserted, it is better not to have other links in the text, or there may be <a class=link href=https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io/issues/171>parsing error <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Also, I am not sure if I can provide the h-entry and the links it contains in a correct format. <a class=link href=https://webmention.rocks/test/1>Webmentioin Rocks! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> told me that I had not provide u-in-reply-to links appropriately during previous tests, though this seems like a <a class=link href=https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.rocks/issues/38>bug <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Having just talked about Webmentions, on my end of this website, the work that needs to be done is to parse the Webmentions and display them on the page. I chose <a class=link href=https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js>webmention.js <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by <a class=link href=https://github.com/PlaidWeb>PlaidWeb <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get the work done, and made some adaptations to let the script use my own simple i18n system. In addition, I have also added the ability to switch between Comments and Webmentions, and added a manual send feature to the Webmentions interaction system.</p><p>After all these operations, my website has obtained a lot of terrible codes, again…It’s time for me to keep doing my graduation project.</p><hr><p>The End</p><hr class=footnotes-sep><section class=footnotes><ol class=footnotes-list><li class=footnote-item id=fn1><p>“Not think this is cool?

So I took a treacky approach, which is to generate both Chinese site and English site within the same repository, with each site using its own configuration, theme configuration, the <code>source</code> directory, and the <code>public</code> directory; and the rest of the contents required to generate sites such as the <code>scaffolds</code> directory and the <code>scripts</code> directory are shared between these sites. Thus, even though the Chinese site and the English site together is coherent, these are two indivisual sites with each static resources placed in its own <code>public</code> directory. To facilitate site generation, I wrote several scripts which are capable of cleaning up intermediates, including some of the same resources in the two <code>source</code> directories of both sites, switching the language used to generate the site based on parameters. You may have noticed that there is an “info icon” (It has moved to the lower right corner as a “language button” for now.) in the upper right corner of some posts (for example, this one) and pages. It indicates that the page you are reading is available in multiple languages, and you can switch to other versions just by clicking that icon. This feature is supported by a metadata generator and filter, an injector, and a broswer-end runtime script that I wrote. When I intend to write two language versions of a post, I provide an array of paths (each path represents the post in a specific language) in the front-matter, embed the metadata in the page via the metadata generator and filter, read it in the browser via the broswer-end script injected by the injector, and then display the “info icon”. The broswer-end script I mentioned is a script that I use to implement specific features and perform modifications dynamically. This script itself contains some prompt strings, so I also wrote simple i18n functions to provide these strings both in Chinese and in English. Now the website has two language versions, each has a root of <code>/zh-CN/</code> or <code>/en/</code>. However, the previous links that search engines had indexed does not inlude the “language mark”, so I also wrote the <code>index</code> and <code>404</code> page for the entire site to direct visitors to the correct page.</p><p>Basically, this is how I implemented a bilingual Hexo site. Maybe I’ll try to blog in English. Maybe.</p><hr><p>The End</p>]]></content><summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This site is now available both in Chinese and in English.</p>]]></summary><category term="Technologies &amp; studies" scheme="https://his2nd.life/en/categories/technologies-and-studies/"/><category term="Front-end" scheme="https://his2nd.life/en/tags/front-end/"/><category term="JavaScript" scheme="https://his2nd.life/en/tags/javascript/"/></entry></feed>
